## Conventions

### Task Status Markers

```
[ ]   Not started
[~]   In progress
[x]   Complete
[!]   Blocked or needs decision
```

### Task Types

Tasks are labeled by type where relevant:

- **[code]** — write or modify code
- **[config]** — configuration or environment
- **[test]** — write or run a test
- **[verify]** — manual verification step
- **[decision]** — needs a choice before proceeding
- **[research]** — needs investigation before implementation

### Dependency Notation

Tasks marked `↳ depends on: [X]` must not be started until the referenced task is complete.

## Development Environment

Before starting Phase 1, the dev environment should be confirmed:

- [ ] [config] NixOS mini PC is the primary workstation
- [ ] [config] `flake.nix` in repo root provides Go toolchain, DuckDB CLI, SQLite CLI
- [ ] [config] `.env` file in project root for local dev (not committed)
- [ ] [config] VS Code or editor with Go plugin configured
- [ ] [verify] `go version` → 1.23+
- [ ] [verify] Apex is reachable at its local IP from the mini PC
- [ ] [verify] Browser DevTools capture plan is understood (see Phase 1)

## Phase Sequencing

Phases 1–3 are strictly sequential. Phase 4 (frontend) can begin after Phase 2 API endpoints are functional — the CLI (Phase 3) can be developed in parallel with Phase 4. Phase 5 (MCP) requires Phase 3 (CLI) to be working. Phases 6 and 7 are independent of each other and can proceed in any order after Phase 4.

```
Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 ─────────────────────────→ Phase 5
                   └──────→ Phase 4 → Phase 6 → Phase 7
```

## Definition of Done (per phase)

Each phase has a **Deliverable** — a concrete, verifiable end state. A phase is not complete until its deliverable is met, regardless of individual task checkboxes.

Deliverables are listed at the top of each phase file.
